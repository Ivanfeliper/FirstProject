                        One Hundred Years of Solitude is a 1967 novel by Colombian author Gabriel García Márquez that tells the multi-generational story of the Buendía family, 
                        whose patriarch, José Arcadio Buendía, founded the town of Macondo. The novel is often cited as one of the supreme achievements in world literature.

                        Macario is the story of a poor man who has been hungry all his life. He suffers from a gnawing poverty which never quite kills,
                        but also never quite permits any visible change or hope. Despite his acceptance of his colorless existence, 
                        he has a fantasy which becomes a tacit means of survival, nourishing him far more than does his meager daily diet. This book is #34 in the Cervantes & Co. Spanish Classics series.

                            Pedro Páramo is a novel written by Mexican writer Juan Rulfo about a man named Juan Preciado, 
                            who promises his mother at her deathbed to meet his father for the first time in Comala, 
                            only to come across a literal ghost town. That is, a town populated by spectral figures, 
                            who reveal details about their own lives (and afterlife) and about Preciado's father: Pedro Páramo.[1][2] Initially, 
                            the novel was met with cold critical reception and sold only two thousand copies during the first four years; later, however, the book became highly acclaimed.[3] Páramo was a key influence on Latin American writers such as Gabriel García Márquez.

                            El laberinto de la soledad) is a 1950 book-length essay by the Mexican poet Octavio Paz. One of his most famous works, 
                            it consists of nine parts: "The Pachuco and other extremes", "Mexican Masks", "The Day of the Dead", "The Sons of La Malinche", 
                            "The Conquest and Colonialism", "From Independence to the Revolution", "The Mexican Intelligence", "The Present Day" and "The Dialectic of Solitude". 
                            After 1975 some editions included the essay "Post data", which discusses the massacre of hundreds of Mexican students in 1968. 
                            (Paz abandoned his position as ambassador in India in reaction to this event.) The essays are predominantly concerned with the theme of Mexican identity and demonstrate how, at the end of the existential labyrinth, there is a profound feeling of solitude
